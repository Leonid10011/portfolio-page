## Introduction

This Project is a first attempt to create a portfolio page, where I display my upcoming projects. It's main focus is to apply the concepts I learned so far about React and frontend development. We use no API connections and solely use static content to present the content. 

## Packages Used
- React as the main frontend framework
- React Router
- Tailwind for styling

## Patterns
- Single Responsibility Principle
